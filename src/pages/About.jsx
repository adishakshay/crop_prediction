      <p className="about-intro">
        Farming is the backbone of our nation, but farmers often struggle with
        uncertainty‚Äîabout crops, weather, diseases, and profits. At
        <strong> NetPlough</strong>, we are changing that. Using the power of
        Artificial Intelligence, we provide simple, practical, and
        farmer-friendly solutions that help farmers make smarter decisions and
        get better yields.

          <h2>üìñ Our Story</h2>
          <p>
            NetPlough was born out of a simple idea:{" "}
            <em>
              what if every farmer had access to the same intelligence that
              scientists and experts use?
            </em>{" "}
            We saw farmers losing profits due to wrong crop choices, unexpected
            weather, and lack of timely information. That‚Äôs why we built
            NetPlough ‚Äî a platform that brings technology directly to the soil.
